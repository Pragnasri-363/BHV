# Backend Implementations to-do:
This document contains the minimal backend components required to support the core BHV functionality.

## Prior Implementations:

Some experimental work in the repository has previously explored:

- basic application scaffolding (including an `app.py` entry point)
- initial template/layout structure
- image upload flow
- file type and size validation
- file storage layout

These efforts were exploratory in nature and were not merged
into the `dev` branch. The current state of the repository
treats the backend as not yet implemented.

## Core Backend Components:

- Image upload endpoint
- File type and size validation
- EXIF metadata stripping
- File system storage abstraction
- Metadata indexing
- Admin moderation hooks
